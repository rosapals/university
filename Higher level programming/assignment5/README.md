- `test_requesting_urls.py`. Runs three tests on `requesting_urls.py` and writes to files
- Three output files `studio_ghibli_out.txt`, `star_wars_out.txt` and `with_params_out.txt`. The output files from the test runs

To run tests write in terminal:
```sh
$ python3 requesting_urls/test_requesting_urls.py
